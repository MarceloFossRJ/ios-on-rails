## About this book

*The book is currently in Beta. These means we are actively writing and revising
content and the example applications. You'll receive all updates to the book and
have direct access to the GitHub repository for the book and example
applications, where you can watch the magic happen and file GitHub issues.*

Welcome to the iOS on Rails eBook sample. This is published directly from the
book, so that you can get a sense for the content, style, and delivery of the
product.  We’ve included three sample sections. One is specific to Rails and
shows how to handle GET requests. The last two are iOS specific, and cover
creating your API client from scratch or with AFNetworking.

If you enjoy the sample, you can get access to the entire book and sample
application at:

<https://learn.thoughtbot.com/products/25-ios-on-rails>

The eBook covers intermediate to advanced topics on creating iOS client and Ruby
on Rails server applications.

In addition to the book (in HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Kindle formats), you also get
two complete example applications, an iOS and a Rails app.

The book is written using Markdown and pandoc, and hosted on GitHub. You get
access to all this.  You can also use the GitHub comment and issue features to
give us feedback about what we’ve written and what you’d like to see.
