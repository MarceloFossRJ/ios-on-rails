# Stuff to Do

- Upload the Cocoapods version DONE
- Create one with Carthage? Hmm. DO
- Love static cells, but am not loving the storyboard heaviness of the book... re-think this
- Add an excerpt about not including pods in a repo vs including them in the repo and why I included them in this example app (easier setup for learning)
